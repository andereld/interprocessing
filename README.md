# interprocessing

A tool for experimenting with using genetic algorithms to find parameter
settings for cross-adaptive audio effects.

This project is based on Ã˜yvind Brandtsegg's
[interprocessing](https://github.com/Oeyvind/interprocessing) project.
However, it is unlikely to be merged into that project, therefore it is not
a (GitHub) fork.
